## Rocket Launcher with Display and Firecontrol
Adds two new features to the standard Rocket Launcher.
* Using the IR control to click 1-9 will determine how many rockets to fire in a burst
* Pushing "OK" will fire 1 as normal
* Pushing Hash/# will fire the set amount of rockets (roughly, timetimes plus/minus one)
* The 7-segment display will show how many rockets will be fired when hitting Hash/#
